# caddyLander To-Do

Trimmed backlog for the next iteration.

1. **Dynamic placeholders in `content.json`** — Support resolving tokens such as `{thisIP}`, `{theCaddyIP}`, or `{theGatewayIP}`.
2. **Caddyfile-driven content generation** — Allow a `content.json` block that reads from the Caddyfile to populate links.
3. **Admin layout/panel tweak** — Move the admin panel to the side or add a live preview pane.
4. **Theme toggle** — Independent dark/light modes for the landing page and the admin UI.
5. **Easter egg** — Optional BalatroTUI link in `content.json` if the payload stays lightweight.
